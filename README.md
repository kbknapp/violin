## Violin - The Pitch

Violin is an implementation of Vivaldi network coordinates that works in
`no_std` and no `alloc` environments. Each coordinate is small consisting of a
dimensional vector made up of an array of `f64`s. The arrays use const
generics, so they can be as small as a single f64 or large as one needs.
Although above a certain dimension there are diminishing returns.

Nodes can measure real latencies between an origin node, or each-other to
adjust their coordinates in space.

The real power comes from being able to calculate distance between a remote
coordinate without ever having done a real latency check. For example node `A`
measures against node `Origin`, node `B` does the same. Then `A` can be given
the coordinates to `B` and accurately estimate the latency without ever having
measured `B` directly.

## Violin - The Anti-Pitch

Vivaldi isn't a magic bullet and still requires measuring real latencies to
adjust the coordinates. In a naive implementation, conducting a latency check
prior to a coordinate calculation is not much better than just using the
latency check directly as the answer. However, this is not how it's supposed to
be used.

Transferring a Violin coordinate in practice can be comparable data to a small
set of ICMP messages. For example an 8-Dimension coordinate (plus three
additional `f64`s of metadata) is 88 bytes. However, unlike ICMP messages, the
Violin coordinates are a single transmission and only need to be re-transmitted
on significant change. Work could even be done to only transmit deltas as well.

## Compile from Source

Ensure you have a [Rust toolchain installed][rustup], and have cloned the repository locally.

```sh
RUSTFLAGS='-Ctarget-cpu=native' cargo build --release
```

**NOTE:** The `RUSTFLAGS` can be omitted. However, if on a recent CPU that
supports SIMD instructions, and the code will be run on the same CPU it's
compiled for, including this flag can improve performance.

## Usage

See the `examples/` directory in this repository for complete details, although
at quick glance creating three coordinates (`origin`, `a` and `b`) and updating
`a` and `b`'s coordinate from experienced real latency would look like this:

```rust
use std::time::Duration;
use violin::{heapless::VecD, Coord, Node};

// Create two nodes and an "origin" coordinate, all using a 4-Dimensional
// coordinate. `VecD` is a dimensional vector.
let origin = Coord::<VecD<4>>::rand();
let mut a = Node::<VecD<4>>::rand();
let mut b = Node::<VecD<4>>::rand();

// **conduct some latency measurement from a to origin**
// let's assume we observed a value of `0.2` seconds...
//
// **conduct some latency measurement from b to origin**
// let's assume we observed a value of `0.03` seconds...

a.update(Duration::from_secs_f64(0.2), &origin);
b.update(Duration::from_secs_f64(0.03), &origin);

// Estimate from a to b even though we never measured them directly
println!("a's estimate to b: {:.2}ms", a.distance_to(&b.coordinate()).as_millis());
```

## Benchmarks

A set of benchmarks are included using 8D, 4D, and 2D coordinates both using
`heap::VecD` (requires the `alloc` feature) and `heapless::VecD`.

The benchmarks measure both the higher level `Node` as well as a lower level
`Coord` abstractions.

To measure we create 10,000 coordinates and the coordinates are
update for each coordinate 100 times, totaling 1,000,000 updates.

On my 8 core AMD Ryzen 7 5850U laptop with 16GB RAM the benchmarks look as
follows:

| Abstraction | Memory   | Dimensions | Time |
| :-: | :-:      | :-:        | :-:  |
| `Node` | heap     | 8          | 66.537 ms |
| `Coord` | heap     | 8          | 55.402 ms |
| `Node` | heapless | 8          | 24.997 ms |
| `Coord` | heapless | 8          | 16.552 ms |
| `Node` | heap     | 4          | 49.501 ms |
| `Coord` | heap     | 4          | 39.163 ms |
| `Node` | heapless | 4          | 16.795 ms |
| `Coord` | heapless | 4          | 11.780 ms |
| `Node` | heap     | 2          | 54.363 ms |
| `Coord` | heap     | 2          | 46.001 ms |
| `Node` | heapless | 2          | 13.181 ms |
| `Coord` | heapless | 2          | 10.916 ms |

To run the benchmarks yourself use `RUSTFLAGS='-Ctarget-cpu=native' cargo bench`.

### Notes on `no_std` Performance

The `no_std` version is _much_ slower because it cannot use platform intrinsics
for square roots, floating point rounding, etc. Instead these functions had to
be hand written.

Additionally, the `no_std` square root functions round up to 8 decimals of
precision.

One should realistically only use the `no_std` version when there is a good
reason to do so, such as an embedded device that absolutely does not support
`std`.

A single Vivaldi calculation only requires one square root calculation per
distance estimate. So pragmatically, it should be rare where such a device is
_also_ needing to calculate thousands of square root operations per second.

But I still hear you, how much slower you ask? Here is the same table (although
only `heapless::VecD`), still 1,000,000 updates:

| Abstraction | Memory   | Dimensions | Time |
| :-: | :-:      | :-:        | :-:  |
| `Node` | heapless | 8          | 6.4303 s  |
| `Coord` | heapless | 8          | 6.3707 s |
| `Node` | heapless | 4          | 6.5513 s |
| `Coord` | heapless | 4          | 6.4179 s |
| `Node` | heapless | 2          |  6.5722 s|
| `Coord` | heapless | 2          |  6.3005 s |

Again, it should be rare for a low power device to need to do
1,000,000 updates rapidly and not have the ability to use `std`.
